## App Idea 💡

I've created this app on my free time as a side project. Because I'm a huge love of the big screen, whether those funny sitcoms from sfriends, How I met Your Mother, or Seinfeld, to those tense dramas and action like the legendary Breaking Bad & Game of thrones, I've allways wanted to built an app that collects all those great tv shows and movies for people to discover and watch!. I tend to work on many side projects on my free time to keep a refreshed memory, while it's also a lot of fun! If you like what I do, hit me up & lets chat!
